# Curse of the Pharaoh (Clone)

This is a new implementation of an old university programming task. It was developed with TDD and the concept of
client-first design with MVC. The design is probably not perfect, but in the end it was an interesting exercise. A few
(maybe unimportant) things on my test list are still open. I note them here, in case, I want to work on it again.

## Test List

- Maybe the model should notify the view to display a new digging point.
  [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_Controller#Modell_(model)) says so.
- The triangle could calculate a ``Dimension``, which then could be used to set the frame or panel size automatically.
- Calculate or simply set a start digging point in a constructor.
